Project 1: Sales and products overview report.
This project was done using Microsoft's AdventureWorks database, along with an additional budget file. The project consists on using SQL Server to perform 
simple data treatments to prepare the data for the report dashboard. The dashboard was developed using Power BI using the transformed data from SQL Server.

The dashboard provides insights into critical sales metrics such as sales vs budget, sales by product category, among others, as well as a product report, 
where relevant information such as top selling products and the sales information for each product by category.

The files contain the SQL queries, the cvs files of the dimension and facts tables, and the Power BI dashboard.
