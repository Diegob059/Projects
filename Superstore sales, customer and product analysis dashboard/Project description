This project consists of the creation of a dashboard with key metrics and KPIs on sales, customers, and products. The dataset used is the superstore dataset available in Kaggle.
The project consists of the following steps:
1) Data cleaning in Excel by removing blank spaces and correcting data types.
2) Data manipulation in SQL Server by further filtering data and creating a unique product ID for each product, as well as several analysis such as segment avg, top selling products,
and manufactories with the best selling products.

The files included in this folder are the cleaned dataset (superstore_dataset), the SQL script (superstore_data_extraction), and the Power BI file with the reports (Superstore-sales_report)
