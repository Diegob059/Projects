This project consists on the creation of a customer finantial information analysis dashboard and a banking information dashboard. 
The first dashboard simulates the user interface of a banking app, and the second dashboard contains relevant information, metrics and KPIs for the bank. This project uses the
Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI machine learning repository.
This project consists of the following parts:

1) A treatment of the data and the creation of synthetic data (customer ID, transaction ID, transaction number, transaction value, transaction date, and name columns) using Python

2) Further data treatment and creation of views in SQL Server with segmentations such as customers by age and customers by job, a transaction pattern analysis, and a suspicious activity analysis
that identifies customers where total withdrawals are greater than 50% of the account balance.

3) Creation of the dashboard and relevant measures for total deposits and withdrawals, a loan eligibility status based on a loan score calulated based on age, job and balance, among others.

This folder contains the original dataset, the Jupyter notebook, the resulting dataset, the SQL script that contains a stored procedure to create the views, and the Power BI file with the dashboards.
