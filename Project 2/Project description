Project 2: Superstore sales
This project was created using the Superstore database from Kaggle.
The project consists of cleaning the data of the original database by removing cernatin duplicates, eliminating blanks spaces and rows, and correcting data types.
The data was then filtered using SQL Server, and as the  original database lacked product ID numbers, a sequence was used to create individual product IDs.
Also, new columns containing the year, month and day of the transactions were added to be used in the development of the report.
The report was done using Power BI, where a dashboard with three pages was developed: sales analysis, customer analysis, and product analysis. Each page has key
metrics and KPIs relevant to the information being analyzed.
